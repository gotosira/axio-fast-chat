## Understanding Value Proposition and JTBD

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

- **Functional Jobs**: What customers are trying to accomplish
- **Emotional Jobs**: How customers want to feel
- **Social Jobs**: How customers want to be perceived

### JTBD Template

> "When [situation], I want to [job], so I can [expected outcome]"

---

## Value Proposition Canvas

Use the Value Proposition Canvas to align product features to customer needs, jobs, pains, and gains.

### Case Study: Airbnb

[Insert practical workshop content as needed]

## Creating and Maintaining Product Vision

### Hierarchy

| Company Level | Product Level |
|---------------|----------------|
| Mission, Vision, Values | Product Vision |
| Objectives & Key Results | How value will be created |
| Themes | Problems to solve |
| Features & Solutions | What will be built |

### A Good Product Vision

- States the main goal of the product
- Clarifies the problem being solved
- Defines value delivered to users

## Product Vision Board Components

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Target Group** | Who are the primary users (e.g., students, professionals) |
| **Pain Points** | e.g., boring online learning, lack of feedback |
| **Product Value** | How the product solves the pain |
| **Key Features** | e.g., personalized feedback, AI-based course recommendations |
| **Business Goals & KPIs** | e.g., 20% premium signups, $10M revenue in 3 years |
| **Market Trends** | e.g., EdTech growing at 16% CAGR to 2030 |
| **Competitors** | e.g., Coursera, Udemy |
| **Competitive Advantage** | e.g., AI personalization, real-time engagement |
| **Revenue Streams** | Pay-per-course, B2B partnerships |
| **Cost Factors** | Dev cost, outsourcing, marketing |

## Differentiation and Competitive Analysis

### Why Do Competitive Research?

- Identify standard features and best practices
- Learn how others solve problems
- Discover innovation opportunities
- Uncover unmet customer needs
- Avoid reinventing the wheel

### Types of Competitors

1. **Direct** – Offer same product to same customers
2. **Indirect** – Substitutes or similar offerings
3. **Complementary** – Products that enhance yours

---

## Where to Find Competitive Data

1. **Online research** – Sites, blogs, reviews
2. **Use competitor’s product**
3. **Talk to users**
4. **Attend trade shows and conferences**

---

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Your Product | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Feature 1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Feature 2 | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| UX | Excellent | Good | Poor |

---

## OKR Framework

### Structure

- **Objective (O)**: Bold, inspirational goal
- **Key Results (KR)**: Measurable outcomes

#### Example OKRs

**Objective:** Increase user engagement

- KR1: Increase avg. session time from 10 to 25 mins
- KR2: Grow DAUs by 12%
- KR3: Launch 3 UX improvements from competitor research

### OKR vs KPI

| OKRs | KPIs |
|------|------|
| For growth and transformation | For operational performance |
| Aspirational | Baseline performance |
| Change-focused | Ongoing tracking |

## OKR Example (Shopee)

| Objective | Key Results |
|-----------|-------------|
| Justify beta launch | - 50 signups by Mar 31<br>- 200 emails collected<br>- 25 referrals with discount |
| App pays for itself in 1 year | - $10K subscriptions Q3<br>- 100 referrals<br>- $25K subscriptions Q4 |

## Product Roadmap and Stakeholder Needs

### Product Roadmap Definition

A strategic document that communicates the product vision, priorities, and delivery path.

### Characteristics of a Good Roadmap

- Not a project plan
- Focused on **needs**, not just features
- Based on **outcomes**, not just output
- Continuously adaptable

### Who's Involved?

- **PO/PO Manager** – Align teams
- **BP/Customers** – Input & feedback
- **Squad/UX** – Feasibility and dependencies
- **Executives/DM** – Strategic alignment

## Roadmap Structure

| Timeline | Themes | Features | OKRs |
|----------|--------|----------|------|
| Q1       | Onboarding | Guided intro flow | KR1, KR2 |
| Q2       | Engagement | Personalized dashboard | KR3 |
| Q3       | Retention | Smart notifications | KR4 |
