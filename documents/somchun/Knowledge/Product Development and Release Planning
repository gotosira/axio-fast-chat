# Product Development and Release Planning

## Agenda

- Product Development  
- Release Planning  
- Prioritization Framework  
- Risk Assessment & Continuous Improvement  
- Product Metrics  
- Validate Product Assumption  

---

## Product Development Methodology

### Waterfall Development Framework

1. Define problem scope and strategy  
2. Investigate problem to define requirements (what)  
3. Design solution (how)  
4. Implement the design  
5. Test the solution  
6. Improve based on feedback or environment  

### Agile Development Framework

- Iterative sprint-based delivery  
- Embraces change, suited for complex work  
- Team delivers working software every sprint  

### Agile vs Waterfall Comparison

| Waterfall | Agile |
|-----------|-------|
| Sequential delivery | Continuous delivery |
| Fixed requirements | Flexible and adaptive |
| End-loaded testing | Ongoing testing |
| Centralized planning | Collaborative ownership |

---

## Agile Overview

### Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

### Role of Product Manager

- Communicate feature priorities  
- Remove blockers for the team  
- Test and iterate based on user feedback  

---

## Agile Building Blocks

- **Epic**: Work too large for one sprint  
- **PBI**: Work deliverable in one sprint, with MD estimation  
- **Frameworks**: Scrum, Kanban, XP, SAFe  

---

### Scrum Ceremonies

1. Sprint Planning  
2. Daily Standup  
3. Backlog Refinement  
4. Sprint Review  
5. Sprint Retrospective  

---

## Agile Metrics

- **Velocity**: Work completed per sprint  
- **Burndown Chart**: Tracks sprint progress  

### Case: Sansiri Agile Success

- Cross-functional squads (e.g., HR, IT, Marketing)  
- 12 squads managing 3 high-rise projects  
- Increased collaboration and efficiency  

---

## Kanban Overview

- Visual board with task status  
- WIP (Work in Progress) limits  
- Continuous flow, no sprints  

---

## Agile Workshop

**Objective**: Pass ball for maximum points  

**Rules**:

1. No passing to adjacent people  
2. Score when ball touches all hands  
3. Use hands only  
4. Ball must have airtime  

3 Rounds: Planning → Doing (2 mins each)

---

## Validate Product Assumption

### From Assumptions to Hypotheses

- **Problem**: Hard to pay → Avoid app  
- **Hypothesis**: Simplify payment → More usage  
- **Features**:
  - Add multiple credit cards  
  - Default payment method  
  - Payment split  
  - PromptPay QR  

---

## Working with Prototypes

**Purpose**:
- Communicate ideas  
- Iterate quickly  
- Align team  
- Validate assumptions  

---

## Working with MVPs

**Definition**: Minimum viable product is the least work that yields max learning

**When to build what**:

| Now | Later |
|-----|-------|
| Critical features | Nice-to-have features |
| Validate assumptions | Lower-risk ideas |
| Manual processes OK | Automation comes later |

---

## Definition of Done

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Epic | Large work body, broken down |
| PBI | Sprint-sized, business-value task |

**AXONS Standard PBI**:

1. Clear goal  
2. Acceptance criteria  
3. Linked to Epic  
4. Includes estimation  

---

## Release Planning

### Three Questions

1. What value do we create?  
2. What resources do we need?  
3. When can it be delivered?  

**Agile Triangle**:
- Focus on **Must-Have** only  
- Avoid **Scope Creep**  
- Use team capacity wisely  

---

### Phase Planning Example

**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
- Online menu  
- Ordering  
- Payment  
- Notification  
- Admin  

**Phase 2 (Growth)**:
- Promotion  
- Reviews  
- Loyalty  
- Chatbot  
- Delivery Integration  

---

### Effort Estimation Tools

- **T-Shirt Sizing**  
- **Story Points**  
- Prioritization: MoSCoW, RICE, DICE  
- Align cost to effort (Dev, QA, Ops, Training)

---

## Feature Prioritization

### MoSCoW Method

| Must-Have | Should-Have | Could-Have | Won’t-Have |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Critical | Important | Nice to have | Not in this release |

### Other Tools

- 2x2 Matrix  
- Stack Ranking  
- Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent vs Important)  
- BCG Matrix (Stars, Cash Cows, Dogs, Question Marks)  

---

## RICE Framework

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reach | Monthly affected users |
| Impact | Business value (1-5) |
| Confidence | Certainty (%) |
| Effort | Required resources |

**Formula**:  
- (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

---

## DICE Framework

| DICE | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Dominance | Who is requesting? |
| Impact | Benefit to business |
| Confidence | Feasibility |
| Effort | Time & resources |

**Why use it**:
- Allocate resources smartly  
- Remove team bias  
- Align stakeholders  

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

> "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."

**Risk Levels**: Very Low → Very High  
**Factors**:
- Control vs Uncontrollable  
- Technology, People, Change, Project  

**5x5 Risk Matrix** for evaluation

---

## Continuous Improvement: AXONS PDCA

Plan → Do → Check → Act

Group activity: Assess risk using 5x5 matrix and propose mitigation

---

## Discovery Approaches

| Formal Discovery | Continuous Discovery |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Pre-dev research | Ongoing insight gathering |
| Time/resource heavy | Lightweight and iterative |
| Clear scope | Flexible scope |

---

### Case Studies

- **GrabMart (Formal)**:  
  - Research + pilot testing  
  - COVID-era demand validation  

- **GrabMart (Continuous)**:  
  - A/B Testing  
  - Heatmaps  
  - UX experiments  

---

## Assumption → Hypothesis → Validation

- Everything starts as an assumption  
- Hypothesis = measurable version  
- Validation = A/B Test, Data, Interviews  

---

## Feedback Collection

| Type | Methods |
|------|---------|
| Direct | Surveys, Analytics, A/B Testing |
| Indirect | Social listening, Ideas portal, Fake door tests |

**B2B Tip**: Focus on decision makers; use Customer Success strategy
