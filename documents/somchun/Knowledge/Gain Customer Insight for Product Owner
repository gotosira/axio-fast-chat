## Morning Session: Data-Driven Decision Making

### Product Life Cycle Stages

1. **Introduction** – High cost, low profit, awareness phase  
   _e.g., Apple Vision Pro, New EV models_
2. **Growth** – High demand, growing competition  
   _e.g., Samsung Galaxy, Bubble Tea_
3. **Maturity** – Saturated market, focus on retention  
   _e.g., Hybrid cars, Coca-Cola_
4. **Decline** – Falling sales, need for strategy shift  
   _e.g., iPod, Compact Digital Cameras_

### Customer Centricity

#### Case: Nokia's Decline
- Failed to adapt to user needs post-iPhone launch
- Used outdated Symbian vs iOS/Android
- Lost market share from 40% to 3%

#### Case: Shopee Thailand
- Focused on user behavior via analytics
- Features like Shopee Live, Shopee Guarantee
- Surpassed Lazada with campaigns and buyer-seller alignment

---

### Data-Driven Product Development Cycle

1. **Collect relevant data**
2. **Analyze for improvement**
3. **Apply findings**
4. **Iterate continuously**

#### Example Data Sources

- Transaction & Purchase Data
- Demographics
- Web/App Analytics
- Social Sentiment
- IoT Sensor Data

#### Real Example

> Feedback: "Highlight selected item more clearly."
> Action: Color adjustment in UI

## Data Analysis and Interpretation

### Key Concepts for PO

- **Setting OKRs/KPIs**
- **Choosing key metrics**
- **Using appropriate tools**

### Examples of Metrics

| Metric | Description | Tool |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **CSAT** | Customer satisfaction % | Google Forms |
| **NPS** | % willing to recommend | Google Forms |
| **Conversion Rate** | Visitor → User % | Google Analytics |
| **Retention Rate** | % users returning | Google Analytics |
| **Churn Rate** | % users dropped | Google Analytics |
| **Referral Rate** | % from referrals | Google Analytics |
| **CAC** | Cost per acquired user | Google Analytics |
| **Feature Adoption** | % using new feature | Google Analytics |

---

### Sample OKRs

**Objective:** Grow app sustainably  
- KR1: New users → 10K to 50K  
- Metric: Conversion Rate  
- Tool: Google Analytics  
- Action: A/B Test different versions

- KR2: Churn Rate → 20% to 10%  
- Action: Analyze feedback and reduce pain points

---

### Group Activity

Define OKRs + Metrics + Tools for your own product:
- Metrics: CSAT, Churn, Retention, Adoption
- Tools: Usability Test, Google Analytics, NPS, A/B Testing

---

## Common Data Pitfalls

- **Misinterpretation** – Inadequate sample size in A/B Test
- **Bias** – Survey only power users
- **Wrong Timeframe** – Promotion periods skew metrics

---

## Cohort & Retention

### Definitions

- **Cohort** = Users starting in the same period
- **Retention** = % returning users over time

### Benefits

1. Understand behavior by group
2. Test feature effectiveness
3. Drive sustainable growth
4. Inform retention strategy

---

### Cohort Analysis Example

- **Jan Cohort**: Poor retention → investigate onboarding issues
- **Feb Cohort**: Better retention → new feature helped?

---

## Correlation vs Causation

| Correlation | Causation |
|-------------|-----------|
| Ice cream sales & summer heat | Hot weather causes ice cream sales |
| Time in app ↑ = good? | Maybe UX confusion, not satisfaction |
| Complaints ↑ = dissatisfaction? | Maybe more user engagement |

---

## Afternoon Session: Leveraging Data for Growth

### User Journey vs Funnel

- **Journey**: Full experience path (e.g., Awareness → Advocacy)
- **Funnel**: Sequential action steps toward a goal

### Journey Mapping Use Cases

- Discovery → Understand current vs ideal state
- Grooming → Prioritize backlog
- After user test → Compare before vs after
- Goal setting → Connect to funnel drop-offs

---

## AARRR Model (Pirate Metrics)

| Stage | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Acquisition** | Attract users (ads, social, SEO) |
| **Activation** | First key action (signup, view) |
| **Retention** | Return usage (DAU, MAU) |
| **Referral** | Sharing with others |
| **Revenue** | Monetization (subscriptions, upsells) |

---

### B2C Case Study: Netflix

| AARRR Stage | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Acquisition | Ads → Clicks on YouTube |
| Activation | Watch full episode |
| Retention | Continue Watching feature |
| Referral | In-app sharing |
| Revenue | Subscriptions via personalized pricing |

---

### B2B Case Adaptation

- Focus on **organizations** not individual users
- Track onboarding, full journey completion
- Add pre-funnel education stage

#### Sample Feature: Custom Dashboard
- Goal: Increase Retention Rate
- Tools: GA tagging, usage monitoring

---

## A/B Testing & Experimentation

### Framework

1. Form hypothesis
2. Set metrics
3. Segment users
4. Develop, test, monitor
5. Analyze results
6. Roll out or iterate

---

### Case Studies

- **KFC**: Added “Best Seller” tag → +3.18% CTA
- **Netflix**: Changed cover images → +14% viewership
- **HubSpot**: Improved hero image → +375 signups/month

---

## Communicating Data to Stakeholders

Use:

- **Funnels + Journey Maps** for visuals
- **Key metrics**: Drop-off, MAU, Cost-Benefit
- **Storytelling**: Justify roadmap decisions

---

## Closing Framework: TIP

- **T**est – Does anyone want it?
- **I**deas – Can we build it better than others?
- **P**ivot – Is the market big enough?
