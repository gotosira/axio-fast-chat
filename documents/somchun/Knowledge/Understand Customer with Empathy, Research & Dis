## Customer Benefit and Customer Research

- **Customer Research**: The process of studying customer needs, behaviors, and problems to gather data for product/service development.
- **Customer Benefit**: The value customers receive. A deep understanding of customers leads to more impactful innovation—not just more features.

### Example: Nike Run Club

- **Customer Benefit**: Inspires people to run
- **Customer Research**:
  - Users lacked motivation to run
  - Loved sharing success on social media

Result: Increased running shoe sales and higher brand engagement.

### Example: Dyson

- **Customer Benefit**:
  - Easy to use
  - Lightweight
  - No dust bag
- **Customer Research**:
  - Users wanted convenience and power
  - Avoid frequent bag changes

Result: Sales doubled in 5 years.

### Example: LEGO Comeback

- Revenue grew 15%+ per year due to customer-centric innovation.

---

## Cautionary Examples

- **Google Glass**: Focused on tech, not real customer needs (privacy, usability).
- **JCPenney**: Removed discounts, ignored emotional buying behavior → Sales dropped 25% in one year.
- **Segway**: Misunderstood product value vs. bicycle utility.

> Deep customer understanding creates differentiation, sales growth, and long-term relationships.

## Problem Statement & Hypotheses

### Problem Statement
- Written from the customer's perspective
- Must be clear and specific

### Hypothesis
- Must connect to the problem statement
- Must be measurable

> "Everything is an assumption until you validate it."

**Example**:

- **Problem**: Customers abandon their carts without checking out.
- **Hypothesis**: If we offer a "free shipping" promotion to near-abandoners, more will complete their purchases.
