# Managing Product Backlog and Requirement  

---

## Backlog Management & Sprint Planning

### Strategy → OKRs → Product Roadmap

- Align product with company vision and strategy
- Example: “Organize the world’s information” → Search Engine, Google Maps, etc.
- Focus on speed, performance, and accessibility

### Recap: OKR

- Starts from “Why → How → What”
- Vision = destination, OKR = goal and measurement

### Recap: Product Roadmap

- A quarterly plan (by sprint or milestone) showing features and epics
- Helps align Tech, Business, and Stakeholders

### Recap: Backlog

> “A good backlog isn’t just a task list — it should answer: *Why are we doing this?*”

- Structure: Epic → User Story → Task
- One single source of truth
- Avoid confusion, duplication, and wasted effort
- Balance multiple work types:
  - ✅ Feature = New work  
  - 🐛 Bug fix = Fix issues  
  - 🔧 Technical debt = Code improvement  
  - 📘 Knowledge = Research, spikes, POCs

## Creating High-Quality PBIs

### INVEST Criteria

- **I**ndependent: Testable without blockers  
- **N**egotiable: Adjustable based on info  
- **V**aluable: Delivers clear value  
- **E**stimable: Can be estimated  
- **S**mall: Small enough for a sprint  
- **T**estable: Clear criteria for QA  

### Azure Backlog Format (Example)

- Header: `[Process][Feature]`
- Sections:
  - Product Metrics
  - Goal
  - Persona / Role
  - Requirement (via User Flow)
  - State
  - Iteration

---

## Sprint Goal

- Set during planning, reviewed post-sprint
- Add summary to “Details” field
- Log problems or urgent work as needed

---

## Team Capacity

- Input per person availability + leave  
- Shared leave → use “Team day off”  
- Use capacity to guide commitment during planning  

---

## Product Backlog Item Structure

### User Flow

- Describe the flow clearly
- Use diagrams, Figma links, and requirements per step

### UI Design

- Add finalized Figma link
- Include annotated screenshots
- Add external content links if any

### Acceptance Criteria

- Detail use cases per PBI
- Add test scenarios in comments or links (e.g., image from Figma)

---

## Related Work

- **Parent Link**: Epic or Feature  
- **Child Link**:  
  - Yellow = Dev/QA task (with effort)  
  - Green = QA scenario (no effort)  
  - Red = Bug (quick fix, no effort)  
- **Related Link**: Supporting tasks (e.g., UI prep)

---

## Detail Effort (Task Level)

- Set **Estimate Effort** before planning ends  
- **Remaining Effort** auto-fills from estimate  
- Log **Actual Effort** after completion  

---

## Prioritization and Backlog Management

> “Not all work is equally important.”

**Why Prioritize?**
- Better resource allocation  
- Create time to focus on what matters  
- Avoid being reactive  

### Prioritization Factors

1. Level of Effort (LoE)  
2. Business Value  
3. Customer Value  

---

## Prioritization Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Value/Effort Score | Rank by benefit vs dev cost |
| Weighted Scoring | Assign weight to key criteria |
| DICE | Combines Dominance, Impact, Confidence, Effort |
| MoSCoW | Must, Should, Could, Won’t have |

### DICE Formula:
- DICE Score = (Dominance × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

## Sprint Planning & Dashboard

- Track sprint in Azure board  
- Sprint Goal, capacity, effort

## Burndown Chart

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Orange Line | Total Scope |
| Blue Area | Remaining Work |
| Gray Line | Ideal Trend |

### Analysis

🧠 Issues:
- Scope increased mid-sprint  
- Tasks not closed  

💡 Tips:
- Lock scope early  
- Trade-off urgent items  
- Improve planning accuracy

## Technical Debts 🔍

> “Technical debt is the future cost of quick solutions today.”

- Incomplete infra, rushed delivery = slow future work
