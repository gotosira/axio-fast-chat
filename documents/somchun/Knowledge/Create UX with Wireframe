## UX vs UI Design

### UX (User Experience)

- Focus: Ease, intuitiveness, and overall usability
- Process: Understanding user needs, journey mapping

### UI (User Interface)

- Focus: Visual layout and interactive components
- Role: Makes interfaces aesthetically pleasing and usable

**Relationship**:  
UX = Structure, research, flow  
UI = Visual and interaction design

## Importance of Intuitive UI

### Norman Doors Example

| Behavior | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| Pull wrong side | 60% |
| Embarrassment | 30% |
| Correct first time | 10% |

## UI Design Principles

### Consistency & Clarity

- Uniform styles (colors, fonts, icons)  
- Predictable components  
- Clear CTAs and layouts  
- Eliminate clutter

### Hierarchy & Accessibility

- Highlight important items (size, contrast)  
- Keyboard-friendly, screen-reader support  
- Readable fonts and clear structure  
- System feedback (loading, selection)

## Eight Principles of Information Architecture (Dan Brown)

1. **Objects** – Treat content as living entities  
2. **Choices** – Limit options to reduce overwhelm  
3. **Disclosure** – Show only what's needed at each step  
4. **Exemplars** – Use examples to clarify categories  
5. **Front Doors** – Users may enter from any point  
6. **Multiple Classification** – Offer varied browsing paths  
7. **Focused Navigation** – Keep related items grouped  
8. **Growth** – Design to scale
